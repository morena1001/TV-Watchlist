# Anime-Watchlist

This site serves as a database for the anime I have watched.

It will include information like the name and if I am currently watching it, Have watched, or have given up on it.

To run on local machine, run commands: "npm install", "cd client", then "npm install". 
Then, to start, run command "npm start" on both the root of the project and inside the client directory.
